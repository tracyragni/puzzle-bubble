# Puzzle Bubble Game

Puzzle Bubble is a simple and fun bubble shooter game built with TypeScript.

## Game Overview

The game consists of a field of colored bubbles. The player shoots bubbles from the bottom of the field, and the goal is to connect three or more bubbles of the same color to make them disappear.

## Acknowledgements

This project was initially based on a web app generated from ChatGPT. It was then modified and expanded with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, which provided valuable code suggestions and solutions throughout the development process.

## Features

- **Bubble Shooter**: The player can aim and shoot bubbles. The direction of the shot is controlled by the mouse movement.
- **Bubble Stacks**: When three or more bubbles of the same color connect, they disappear.
- **Special Black Bubble**: A special black bubble can remove any stack of 3 or more bubbles, regardless of their color.
- **Bubble Counter**: The game displays the remaining number of bubbles.

## Game Mechanics

- **Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions between the shooter bubble and the other bubbles, as well as the walls of the game field.
- **Bubble Stacking**: The game checks for stacks of 3 or more bubbles of the same color and removes them.
- **Shooter Bubble Control**: The player can control the direction of the shooter bubble with the mouse. The bubble is shot when the player clicks the mouse.
